INTRODUCTION

 In this project, a number of questions are asked, and the user is awarded points for each correct answer given.

 In quiz game, questions are chosen in such a a way that they cover all fields of a typical quiz contest. The user’s general knowledge is tested with quiz questions regarding science, technology etc.

 In this quiz game mini project, you can store the user name, view the highest score secured by a user, and even reset the score. 
 
 I have divided this mini project into many functions, and listed below are some of those which may help you understand the project better.

edit_score() – adds the current cash prize won to the previous one upon giving the right answer to a question
help() – help menu with game summary and rules
reset_score() – to reset the highest score/cash prize to default
show_record() – shows the highest cash prize won by a particular user
show_score() – to view the highest score
In this quiz game mini project, you can store the user name, view the highest score secured by a user, and even reset the score. Additionally, to make the game look a little more interesting, it is divided into two rounds; user must pass the first round to reach the second one.

Of the 2 rounds I mentioned above, the first is called the Warm-up Round; the second is the Challenge round. In the warm-up round, the user is asked a total of three simple questions and they must be able to answer at least two of them correctly to enter the next round. If the user is not capable of doing that, he is not permitted to proceed further.
